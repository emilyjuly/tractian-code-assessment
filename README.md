# Tractian – Frontend Technical Challenge

This repository contains my implementation of the Tractian frontend technical challenge.

Due to time constraints related to my current full-time job, I focused on delivering a solid and well-structured foundation that reflects how I work on a daily basis, prioritizing code quality, organization, and responsiveness.

## ✅ What was implemented

### Header

3 main sections of the page

All implemented sections are fully responsive, following the provided reference page behavior and layout

Automatic redirect from / (home) to the original example path:

/[locale]/who-we-serve/plant-manager

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

Next.js (App Router)

React

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS for all styling

Next/Image for image optimization

Internationalized routing structure (i18n-ready)

### 🌍 Routing & Structure

The project uses a locale-based routing structure ([locale]) to support multiple languages.

When accessing the root path (/), the user is automatically redirected to the example page path, matching the challenge requirements.

### 🎨 Styling & Assets

All styles were implemented using Tailwind CSS

Images used in the project were sourced from Pexels, which provides royalty-free images for commercial use

### ⚠️ Scope & Limitations

Only part of the full page was implemented due to limited available time

The focus was on:

clean component structure

responsiveness

maintainability

alignment with the provided design reference

### 🚀 Next Steps (if more time were available)

Complete the remaining page sections

Finalize full i18n support for EN / PT / ES content

Implement full form behavior and validations

Refine animations, transitions, and micro-interactions

Perform visual fine-tuning for pixel-perfect alignment

Improve accessibility (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)

📝 Final Notes

This implementation represents the level of structure, organization, and attention to detail I aim to deliver in real-world projects, even when working under time constraints.

Thank you for the opportunity.
